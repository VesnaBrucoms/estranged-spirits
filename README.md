# Estranged Spirits

Help Aryasi Othral speak to the spirits of her family. Or not!

A mod for Tamriel Rebuilt, *Estranged Spirits* adds a medium sized tomb and an associated quest a little
ways out of eastern Andothren. The quest and Aryasi will react to the player's decisions.

### Directions

To reach Othral Ancestral Tomb and Aryasi, leave Andothren through the east gate and simply follow the road
until you get to a river. Cross it and the tomb will be on your left.
