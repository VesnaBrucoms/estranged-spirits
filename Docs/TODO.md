To test:
* update old OAT ref in repo readme & readme
* greatly "jazz up" the tomb interior
  * darken the ambient light to emphasise the lights
  * more temple banners through most of the rooms
  * additional temple books in lecturn area (benches to put the books onto)
    * 36 sermons, pilgrims path, x door
  * more candles/replace skull torches with candles (standard, blue)
    * Especially in final room
  * more cluttering with offerings at pits & altars (fire petals)
  * cobwebs in the hidden section
* add some candles to the exterior

Changes:
