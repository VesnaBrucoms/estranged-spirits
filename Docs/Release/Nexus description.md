Help Aryasi Othral speak to the spirits of her family. Or not!

### Full

A mod for Tamriel Rebuilt, *Estranged Spirits* adds a medium sized tomb and an associated quest a little
ways out of eastern Andothren. The quest and Aryasi will react to the player's decisions.

Adds:
* A medium sized tomb
* A short quest, *Estranged Spirits*, to take you through the tomb
* **127 lines of dialogue**, allowing for:
  * The quest to have many endings and routes through it
  * Aryasi to react differently based on your actions

### Directions

To reach Othral Ancestral Tomb and Aryasi, leave Andothren through the east gate and simply follow the road
until you get to a river. Cross it and the tomb will be on your left.

### Content

The quest deals with themes of [hidden]family ostracization from a [hidden]trans/queer perspective.
