### Short

Help Aryasi Othral speak to the spirits of her family. Or not!

### Full

A mod for Tamriel Rebuilt, *Estranged Spirits* adds a medium sized tomb and an associated quest a little
ways out of eastern Andothren. The quest and Aryasi will react to the player's decisions.

Adds:
* A medium sized tomb
* A short quest, *Estranged Spirits*, to take you through the tomb
* **127 lines of dialogue**, allowing for:
  * The quest to have many endings and routes through it
  * Aryasi to react differently based on your actions

### Directions

To reach Othral Ancestral Tomb and Aryasi, leave Andothren through the east gate and simply follow the road
until you get to a river. Cross it and the tomb will be on your left.

### Content

The quest deals with themes of [hidden]family ostracization from a [hidden]trans/queer perspective.

### Updating from v1.2.0 to v1.2.1

Should present no issues.

### Updating from v1.0.0 or v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

If you're updating from a previous version, it should work unless possibly if you enchanted the Othral
Family Blade. The change to the model and stats might cause issue, but I'm honestly not sure. Might be
best to upgrade at a later point if that's the case.

### Incompatibilities

No known incompatibilities at this point.
