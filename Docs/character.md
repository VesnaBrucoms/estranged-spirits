Aryasi was born into the Othral family as the eldest child of three. Her two younger brothers being
Lletho and Jathys. Nothing of much note happened, though she was a quiet and shy child, which was
a source of tension and frustration with her parents. In particular her father, who tried to get her to
engage with what was expected of her (taking after her father). A bright spot was her grandmother
Uravasa, who she was particularly close to and who taught her magic much to the chagrin of her father.

When she reached the age of ten things took a turn for the worse. First, her grandmother passed away
and despite requesting to converse with her spirit she was denied and was unable to find where she was
buried. She felt alone and withdraw further within herself. Not long after this she felt her life drain
 of colour, and inside she felt deeply empty, far far more than what she had felt when her grandmother
passed.

This worsened as she aged and her body changed. Eventually she realised that she was not what she thought
she was and what everyone saw, but rather a woman and one who took after her grandmother. When she spoke
out to her parents regarding this they were enraged. After many months of pressure to reverse what she was
doing, followed by shaming and humiliation by both her parents and her brothers, she ran away at the age of
16.

Many many years have passed and she never reconnected with her family. Recently she found out that not only
have her parents passed away, but her brothers too. One died in a drunken brawl, and the other went out into
the ashlands but caught blight on the way to ghostgate. A lot of old feelings resurfaced from this news and
she has returned to her family ancesetral tomb to attempt to settle old scars and perhaps attempt to reconcile
with the spirits of her family.

However, even now things are difficult as even the guardians of the tomb attempt to kill her. This is where the
PC comes in.

NOTE: her grandmother was a powerful sourceress in her own right, not anywhere near Telvanni powerful,
but a decent source of strength and direction in her family. Taking on a matriarch/wise woman role within
the family. Which did not sit well with Aryasi's father who married into the family, and came from a strongly
patriarchal family. He did not want Aryasi bonding and becoming like her grandmother as he wanted her to follow
his footsteps as the future patriarch (in his view) of the family.

Uravasa is buried in a secret part of the tomb as that's what she desired, to have her artifacts and precious
items kept extra secure. As the powerful and respected matriarch in life, she was able to get what she wanted.
This fact, and how to get to this part of the tomb, was deliberatly kept from the children as part of the father's
way of gaining more control and asserting himself as the patriarch.
